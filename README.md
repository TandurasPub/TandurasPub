Hi, I’m Michael

I’m interested in mostly back-end develeopment focusing on interesting problems and quickly creating smaller applications for personal use

I’m currently learning a handful of python libraries and some machine learning stuff. 

This page was made recently just to host some small apps I made for friends, but will end up having some more interesting stuff at some point.
