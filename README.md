Hi, I’m Michael

I’m interested in mostly back-end develeopment focusing on interesting problems and quickly creating smaller applications for personal use

This page was made recently just to host some small apps I made for friends, but will end up having some more interesting stuff at some point. 

Currently working on some database piping, various hosting certifications, some data visualization libraries and machine learning stuff.
